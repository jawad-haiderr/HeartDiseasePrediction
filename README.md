Heart Disease Prediction (Classification)

This project predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, heart rate, chest pain type, and more.

I have used a GitHub dataset, the “heart-disease-dataset.csv” from "rikhuijzer/heart-disease-dataset" repo.

Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- XGBoost Classifier  

Why This Project?
This project demonstrates how different classification algorithms perform on real medical data. It covers:

- Data preprocessing  
- Feature scaling  
- Training multiple ML models  
- Comparing accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
- Confusion matrix visualization  

Results
XGBoost performed the best due to its ability to learn complex patterns and feature interactions.
